## Lem-in
Lem-in is the 3rd mandatory project in the Algorithms branch at the [Codam](https://www.codam.nl) curriculum [42 network](https://www.codam.nl/en/the-42-network). In this project we were asked to find the quickest way to move a certain amount of ants through an ant farm. The amount of ants and the structure of the ant farm was indicated in the input file. An ant farm is comprised of ```rooms``` and ```links``` which refers to the corresponding concepts of ```vertices``` and ```nodes``` in a graph. 

### Takeaways 
For this project we took a deep dive in concepts related to graph theory, like :
  - Path finding algorithms (like BFS/DFS).
  - Hash tables in order to store our graph (like Adjacency Lists/Adjacency Matrix).
  - Maximum flow problems (optimization theory) and getting familiar with algorithms like Ford-Fulkerson, Edmonds-Karp and Dinic's algorithm.
